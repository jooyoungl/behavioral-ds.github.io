How does language inform our downstream thinking? In particular how do humans make meaning from language--and how can we leverage a theory of linguistic meaning to build machines that think in more human-like ways? In this paper they propose rational meaning construction a computational framework for language-informed thinking that combines neural language models with probabilistic models for rational inference.,[NeurIPS'23] (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/f9f54762cbb4fe4dbffdd4f792c31221-Paper-Conference.pdf) [NeurIPS'23](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/21f7b745f73ce0d1f9bcea7f40b1388e-Paper-Conference.pdf),,
